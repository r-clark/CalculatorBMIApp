# CalculatorBMIApp
This is my first C# application
My first release, I commented out the error handling for not being able to put strings as an input to the height and weight input boxes, however, when applying this handling, it gets rid of allowing my rounding to the tenth for half inch increments or weight. 
Current .exe allows for decimal input but will crash if a string is put in there.
